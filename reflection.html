        <h1> Reflection Assignment </h1>
        <p> Having completed FSW-105 I found that there were many challenges
            from learning the content to time management. As the work load 
            has increased it has become more dificult to
            manage the time, but i find that the study groups with 
            classmates has helped to set a time to work on school projects.</p>

            <p>Looking back my favorite part of the coure would be the 
                shopper assignment. It was the first time using javascript
                for me and it was dificult but not too dificult. It gave
                me a good idea of what to expect as the class progressed. </p>
